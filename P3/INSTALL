# This text file should explain how to deploy your website.

Prerequisites
######################################################
1. Clone our repository from Markus.


Setting Up the Backend
######################################################
1. Open a terminal. Make sure your current working directory is the cloned repository from the prerequisite step.
2. Run the following commands in the terminal to download the required packages and set up the backend:
cd backend

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install django

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

pip3 install djangorestframework
pip3 install djangorestframework-simplejwt
pip3 install setuptools
pip3 install django-filter
python3 -m pip install django-cors-headers

python3 ./manage.py makemigrations
python3 ./manage.py migrate
3. Now, in the same terminal, run `python3 ./manage.py runserver` to start the backend server.


Setting Up the Frontend
######################################################
1. Open a terminal. Make sure your current working directory is the cloned repository from the prerequisite step.
2. Navigate to the frontend folder by running `cd frontend`
3. Run `npm install` to download the required packages.
4. Run `npm start` to start the frontend server.


How to Deploy Our Website
######################################################
We were only able to deploy our frontend on Vercel before the deadline. The deployment is visible here: https://pet-pal-six.vercel.app/. 
Since our backend was not deployed, there will be no data available on the site. Login/signup features are not usable either.
We wanted to deploy our backend on an AWS EC2 instance and then, from our frontend, fetch data from the deployed backend, but we ran out of time.
